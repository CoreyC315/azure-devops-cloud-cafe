    ## Getting Started (Local Development)

This section guides you through setting up and running the Cloud Caf√© application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Node.js**: [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (includes npm).
* **Git**: [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
* **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: [Download & Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

### Project Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/CoreyC315/azure-devops-cloud-cafe.git](https://github.com/CoreyC315/azure-devops-cloud-cafe.git)
    cd azure-devops-cloud-cafe
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the project directory and install the required Node.js packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **PowerShell Execution Policy (Windows Users):**
    If you encounter errors related to script execution, you might need to adjust your PowerShell execution policy. Open PowerShell **as Administrator** and run:
    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
    ```
    Confirm with 'Y'. This allows locally created scripts to run.

### Running the Application Locally

Start the Node.js Express server:

```bash
node app.js
