# Cloud Caf√©: Scalable Order Management with Azure Kubernetes Service

This project aims to build a highly available and scalable coffee order management web application, "Cloud Caf√©," and deploy it using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). It demonstrates key cloud engineering and DevOps principles, including containerization, local development, version control, and preparing for cloud deployment.

## Technologies Used

* **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
* **Express.js**: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
* **Git**: Version control system.
* **GitHub**: Cloud-based hosting for Git repositories.
* **VS Code**: Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
* **npm**: Node.js package manager.

## Getting Started (Local Development)

This section guides you through setting up and running the Cloud Caf√© application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Node.js**: [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (includes npm).
* **Git**: [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
* **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: [Download & Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

### Project Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/CoreyC315/azure-devops-cloud-cafe.git](https://github.com/CoreyC315/azure-devops-cloud-cafe.git)
    cd azure-devops-cloud-cafe
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the project directory and install the required Node.js packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **PowerShell Execution Policy (Windows Users):**
    If you encounter errors related to script execution, you might need to adjust your PowerShell execution policy. Open PowerShell **as Administrator** and run:
    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
    ```
    Confirm with 'Y'. This allows locally created scripts to run.

### Running the Application Locally

Start the Node.js Express server:

```bash
node app.js
```
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000. You will see console output confirming the port and endpoints.

Testing Endpoints
Once the application is running, open your web browser and navigate to:

http://localhost:3000/

You should see the interactive "Cloud Caf√©" frontend page. From this interface, you can:

View the menu, which is dynamically loaded from the /menu API endpoint.

Select a coffee and quantity to place an order, which sends a POST request to the /order API endpoint.

Enter an Order ID to check its status, which queries the /status/:id API endpoint.

(Optional: You can still test the backend API endpoints directly if needed, e.g., using curl for the POST request, but the frontend provides a complete user experience.)

Next Steps (Cloud Deployment) ‚òÅÔ∏è
The next phases of this project will focus on deploying and managing the Cloud Caf√© application in Azure:

Containerization with Docker

Pushing to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

Deploying to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Implementing Autoscaling

Setting up Monitoring with Azure Monitor

Simulating Production Traffic






Phase 2: Containerization with Docker üê≥
This phase packages the Cloud Caf√© application and its dependencies into a portable Docker image, ensuring consistent execution across different environments.

Dockerfile Explained
The Dockerfile defines the steps to build the application's container image using a multi-stage approach for efficiency:

Dockerfile

# Stage 1: Build (for installing dependencies)
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder # Uses a lightweight Node.js base image for building
WORKDIR /app                    # Sets the working directory inside the container
COPY package*.json ./           # Copies package files for dependency caching
RUN npm install --omit=dev      # Installs only production dependencies

# Stage 2: Run (for the final application image)
FROM node:18-alpine             # Uses a smaller base image for the final runtime
WORKDIR /app                    # Sets the working directory
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules # Copies installed modules from builder stage
# Copy the rest of your application code (app.js, public/, etc.)
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000                     # Declares that the container listens on port 3000
CMD ["node", "app.js"]          # Specifies the command to run the application
Building the Docker Image
Ensure Docker Desktop is running on your machine. From the root of your project directory, execute the following command to build the Docker image:

Bash

docker build -t cloud-cafe-app:latest .
docker build: Initiates the image build process.

-t cloud-cafe-app:latest: Tags the image with the name cloud-cafe-app and version latest.

.: Specifies that the Dockerfile is in the current directory.

Testing the Docker Image Locally
After a successful build, you can run a container from your newly created image and test the application locally:

Bash

docker run -p 3000:3000 cloud-cafe-app:latest
docker run: Creates and starts a container from the specified image.

-p 3000:3000: Maps port 3000 on your host machine to port 3000 inside the container, allowing external access.

cloud-cafe-app:latest: Specifies the Docker image to use.

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/. You should see your Cloud Caf√© frontend, demonstrating the app running successfully within its Docker container. To stop the container, press Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running.
